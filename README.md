   https://renpy.org/latest.html

5. The files are named in the format `chapX`, where `X` is the chapter number. Open the file for the chapter whose dialogue you wish to change
6. Look for the dialogue whose audio you wish to change.<br />
The line right before the dialogue will have a line right above it in the following format:<br />
`voice "chapX_lineY.mp3"`<br />
Where X is the chapter number and Y is the dialogue number. That is the name of the file that needs to be changed.
7. Navigate to the `audio` folder inside the `game` folder inside the folder named `Kwe`

Make sure it is in the same format as the original file and has the same name and extension.

14. Click `Web` under the `Actions` section
15. Click `Build Web Application` and follow the prompts on screen
15. Wait for the process to finish and then close Ren'Py
17. Using your File Browser, navigate to the Project folder selected in `step 10`
18. Open the folder `Kwe-1.0-web` inside the folder `Kwe-1.0-dists` inside the Project folder

of the account named `group15` on the `ugdev.cs.smu.ca` server,<br />
overwriting the existing files with the same name
